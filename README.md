Skyrim Pets is a mod for Skyrim that adds the ability to capture, save, and summon wild creatures in Skyrim. Pets are added and controlled through spells which are sold at a vendor by the Whiterun Stables. The vendors name is George, and can be found in the little wall-less hut near the stables. Around the hut are rows of cabbage.

This is something I worked on in 8th grade, and it became surprisingly popular! As of right now (Fall 2016), there have been more than 15,000 downloads, and 80,000 views. A popular Youtuber named Brodual found the mod and made a video about it, which has also seen significant traffic.
